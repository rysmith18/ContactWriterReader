# ContactWriterReader

Your task is to complete a program that is capable of writing data from
Contact class objects to a file on disk, and then reading them back when
the program starts. To do this, you'll have to do the following:

* Use your own Contact class from previous homework
* Choose a filename, and check to see if the file exists. 
* If the file exists, read the contents and then display them to the user.
* If the file does not exist, simply begin a loop to get new contact information
from the user.
* In your loop to get new contact information, you should use an array to store
each Contact object that the user creates, until the user says they are done.
* When the user says they are done entering contacts, write them to disk at the
file name you chose and then exit the program.
